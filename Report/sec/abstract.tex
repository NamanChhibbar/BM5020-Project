    In this project we aim to implement semantic segmentation model to help with segmentation task during Endoscopic procedure. The literature proposed a DeepLabV3+ model with Resenest101 backbone. We propose a DeepLabV3 model with MobileNetV3-Large as backbone layer which has less number of parameters and layers than Resenest101 hence improving efficiency. We have extracted images from POEM videos and annoted using Segment\_anything model.
