    In this project we aim to implement semantic segmentation model to help with segmentation task during Endoscopic surgery. A DeepLabV3 model with Resnet-101 as backbone and FCN head as auxillary classifier is trained. We have extracted images from POEM videos and annoted using Segment\_anything model.
