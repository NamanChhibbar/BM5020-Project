\subsection{Data Collection}
We have collected 8 POEM videos of length around 40-45 mins each. Total 8000 snapshots are extracted from these videos. The snapshots are cropped to 720 x 930 pixels. Out of these 24 snapshots are annotated with the help of SAM (Segment\_anything \cite{sam-model})  model with 4 classes: \textit{Background, Muscle layer, Mucosal layer, and Electrode}. The annotated snapshots are used to train the model.
